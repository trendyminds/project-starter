# Pura
Pura is an opinionated, but lightweight project starter kit. Powered by ES2015, Node.js, Webpack and more!

## Requirements
- Node 7.8.0 (use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage your Node versions!)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) `npm i -g yarn`

## Setting up
1. Clone/download to your machine
2. Run `yarn` to install dependencies

## ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT! Using Yarn vs. NPM
**Please note:** We are using Yarn on this project and not using NPM. This means **you should not use npm commands when adding/removing dependencies**! Please refer to the [Yarn's documentation](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/migrating-from-npm#toc-cli-commands-comparison) to ensure you are running the correct `yarn` command to:

- Add new dependencies
- Remove dependencies
- Reinstall dependencies
